# Introduction to Linux

## Overview

This document introduces the fundamentals of Linux — why it is widely used, what Linux actually is, and how its core architecture works.

By the end of this document, you will understand:

- Why Linux dominates modern computing  
- What Linux truly means beyond just a name  
- The key architectural components of Linux  
- The difference between Shell and Terminal  
- An overview of Linux distributions  

This serves as the foundation for deeper Linux concepts that will be explored throughout this repository.

# Why Linux?

Linux is one of the most important operating systems in modern computing. Its impact spans servers, cloud platforms, mobile devices, and even space technology.

## Key Reasons

- **Open Source & Free** – Community versions are freely available and can be modified.  
- **Large Community Support** – A global ecosystem of developers continuously improves and maintains it.  
- **Full Control Over System** – Users have complete control over updates and configurations.  
- **Efficient & Lightweight** – Runs smoothly even on minimal hardware resources.

## Where is Linux Used?

Linux powers:

- More than 90% of servers worldwide  
- The majority of supercomputers  
- Android smartphones  
- Cloud infrastructure  
- Networking devices  
- Embedded systems and satellites  

Linux is not just an operating system — it is the backbone of modern computing.

# What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source operating system originally created by **Linus Torvalds**, inspired by UNIX (an earlier operating system).

When people say "Linux", they typically mean a complete operating system made up of multiple components:

```
Linux = Linux Kernel + GNU Tools + Package Manager + Desktop Environment
```

We will explore each of these components in depth in future sections.

# Linux Architecture

Linux architecture consists of multiple layers working together to ensure smooth operation.

```
Hardware
   ↓
Kernel
   ↓
Shell
   ↓
Applications
```

Let’s understand each component clearly.

## 1. Hardware

These are the physical components of the computer system:

- CPU  
- RAM  
- Storage (HDD / SSD)  
- Monitor  
- Keyboard  
- Mouse  
- Network devices  

Hardware provides the foundation on which everything runs.

---

## 2. Kernel

The **Kernel** is the core of the Linux operating system.

It is responsible for:

- Managing CPU usage  
- Managing memory allocation  
- Handling storage devices  
- Controlling device drivers  
- Managing processes  
- Enabling communication between hardware and software  

Without the kernel, the system cannot function.

## 3. Shell vs Terminal

These two terms are often confused, but they are not the same.

### Shell

A **shell** is a program that:

- Reads user commands  
- Interprets them  
- Executes them  

Common shells include:

- `bash`  
- `zsh`  
- `sh`  

The shell acts as a command interpreter between the user and the kernel.

---

### Terminal

A **terminal** is the interface or application that allows a user to interact with the shell.

In simple terms:

- Terminal → The window  
- Shell → The program running inside that window  

The terminal displays output and accepts input, while the shell processes the commands.

---

## 4. Applications

Applications are specialized software programs built to perform specific tasks.

Examples:

- Web browsers (e.g., Chrome)  
- Code editors (e.g., VS Code)  
- Office tools (e.g., LibreOffice)  

Applications depend on the shell and kernel to interact with hardware resources.

# Linux Distributions (Distros)

There are many Linux distributions available, each designed for different purposes.

Some popular distributions include:

- Debian  
- Ubuntu  
- Red Hat  
- Fedora  
- Arch Linux  

In this repository, we will focus primarily on **Ubuntu**.

Although core Linux concepts remain the same across distributions, the main differences lie in:

- Package management tools  
- Default configurations  
- Command variations  
- System management utilities  

Understanding Ubuntu will provide a strong foundation that applies to other distributions as well.

# What’s Next?

This document is just the starting point.

Upcoming topics in this repository include:

- Installing Linux (Virtual Machine & Bare Metal)  
- Linux File System Structure  
- Basic & Advanced Commands  
- User and Permission Management  
- Process Management  
- Networking in Linux  
- Package Management  
- Shell Scripting  
- Linux for DevOps  

Each section will build progressively, strengthening both theoretical understanding and practical skills.

Linux is not just an operating system to learn — it is a system to understand.

And once you understand it, you stop using the computer — you start controlling it.
